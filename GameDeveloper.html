    <h2 class="cover-heading"> Game Developer </h2>
    <p class="lead"><br><strong> The early stages of Joshua's passion for game development started
    in 2016, while he was browsing the internet. He had been looking into web development at that point
    in his life, purely out of curiousity as to how it was done, and stumbled accross tutorials about 
    how to make text based adventure games quickly in Python. When he saw how easily those games were
    able to be made, he became very interested in pursuing more knowledge about how to make bigger and
    better games. This lead him to udemy.com, where he took courses from GameDev.tv, and this is where
    Josh learned the basics of coding, game logic, and how it all comes together in games. Eventually,
    he got bored with C++, and stopped coding for a few months. But then, in 2018, he began classes
    at the College of Innovation and Design, (COID), at Boise State University, and his life was changed for
    the better. In the past, Joshua had struggled with self-discipline, and with caring about the future.

   <h2> Gaming, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology </h2>
   <p class="lead"><br><strong>
    He had struggled with mental health ever since he moved away to Florida. Coming back to Idaho
    didn't fix it...but University did. See, in COID, he was in the GIMM program, or Gaming, Interactive
    Media, and Mobile Technology, and the GIMM program is very unique for a lot of reasons. The biggest
    reason is that the first two semesters are designed to weed out people who aren't disciplined,
    or who wouldn't be able to survive in the professional world of game development. In the first
    semester, we learned how to make games in flash. We made two games, one as individuals, and one
    in groups of students. The first one is a simple project, because most people might be brand new
    to coding. We took one of three very basic prototypes of flash games, and had to make it our own
    through a few coding and design requirements. The second one, which is the one that made most people
    drop out, was a game based on state machines. We had to make the games more or less from scratch,
    with an example state machine based game to reference. This was a rigorous assignment, which
    required a lot of discipline, a lot of teamwork, and learning what every member of the group was
    best at, or what they should be spending their time on. From that point onward, Joshua learned
    that he was quite capable of self-discipline, and that he could do just about anything he really
    wanted to do, which has really been an eye opening realization that he has carried forward throughout
    his undergraduate career.
    Since then in college classes, he has made a 2d animated music video, a robot that collects easter eggs,
    a mobile interactive comic, an educational animated interactive video, a VR short film, a bunch of
    different financial calculators in C#, a game design document for his upcoming game project, and
    this very website.
