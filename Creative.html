    <h2 class="cover-heading"> Creative Background </h2>
    <p class="lead"><br><strong> Creativity is a very broad topic. Joshua was creative as a child, writing
    fictional stories, drawing, even thinking of what games and movies he would make if he ever learned how,
    but he lost that creativity in his teenage years, outside of his passion for music. As he was progressing
    through those years, from time to time, he would try to reclaim his former creativity, trying his 
    hand at art, writing, and creative design, but failing miserably in all of them. He gave up around
    15 years old, choosing instead to focus solely on music, because that was the only place that he was
    still able to be creative. Joshua didn't let this stop him from developing an interest in game 
    development though, because playing video games was just such a big part of his life at the time,
    and somewhere in the back of his mind, he was still attracted to the idea of creating and actualizing
    fiction narratives.
    </strong></p>
    <h2> The Journey </h2>
    <p class="lead"><br><strong>
    In late 2016, he started taking free online courses in game design, and software development. He discovered
    that, while he did not yet have the creativity to design games of his own, he thoroughly enjoyed
    the process of coding a game, designing software logic, and seeing that code be represented visually
    through an app or a game. This ultimately lead him to the life changing experience that was University.
    When he was living in Florida in 2016 after he started taking interest in coding, his family tried
    to get him to dual enroll at the  University of Central Florida, in their wonderful Computer Science
    program. Joshua neither had the confidence to enroll in Computer Science, nor the desire to go to
    college. In 2018 however, his mother discovered the Gaming, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology
    degree at Boise State University, and presented it to Josh. He looked into it, and fell in love
    with the overall structure of the program, and so decided to give it a try.
    </strong></p>
    <h2> GIMM </h2>
    <p class="lead"><br><strong> Gaming, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology, or "GIMM" for short,
    is a broad program which covers all aspects of game development, interactive design, software development,
    and development for mobile and VR platfroms. From the first day that Joshua walked into a GIMM class,
    his life began to change for the better, especially in the realm of creativity. It was a long process,
    but after about a year and a half in the program, there was a sudden moment of realization about
    the very nature of creativity. While Josh was writing a script for an upcoming project, a short film
    in VR, he suddenly understood what it meant to be creative. For the past 6 years, he had been striving
    for a logical approach to creativity, perhaps even an algorithmic way to be creative. Since that moment,
    he has been enjoying writing again, coming up with ideas for video games, and then fleshing them out.
    His ability to come up with creative ideas has more than tripled, and he has inspired himself to
    continue being creative. He has picked up photography, and aspires to actually make his own games
    in addition to joining other peoples projects, and helping them realize their ideas in the form of
    video games.</strong></p>

    <h2> Creative Inspirations </h2>
    <p class="lead"><br><strong> In projects that Joshua has worked on in English classes, and to this
    date, he credits J.R.R Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as his main inspirations in creative writing. He loves
    all of the writings from both authors, and considers them some of the greatest writers of the 20th
    century. In fact, Josh loved their writing so much, that he started to look into what they used to
    help them write, and among other things, he discovered that they both credit smoking pipe tobacco
    as a big part of their creative process. Turns out, most of the great thinkers and creative writers
    of the 20th century also credit the art of smoking pipes as part of their process of writing. It is
    a relaxing art, and it is very helpful for the entire writing process. So, Josh has them to thank, not
    only for their incredible, inspiring works of art, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Lord of the Rings,
    but also for introducing him to the art of smoking pipe tobacco, which has aided him throughout University,
    and helps him come up with great ideas and writings.
